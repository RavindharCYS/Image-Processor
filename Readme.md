### Additional Features
* **Batch Processing**: Apply the same adjustments to multiple images
  * Custom processing profiles that can be saved and reused
  * Queue management with progress tracking
* **Image Filters**: Apply artistic and correction filters
  * Photo filters (Sepia, B&W, Vintage, etc.)
  * Blur effects (Gaussian, Motion, Bokeh)
  * Noise reduction algorithms
* **Text and Watermarking**: Add text or logos to images
  * Font selection with system fonts support
  * Adjustable opacity and positioning
  * Watermark templates that can be saved

## Installation

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher
* Pip package manager

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-processor.git
cd image-processor
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```
python main.py
```

### Dependencies

## Usage

### Basic Workflow
1. **Open an image** using the File menu or Open Image button
2. **Remove background** if needed
3. **Enhance the image** using the adjustment sliders
4. **Add a new background** (solid color or gradient)
5. **Crop if necessary** using the interactive crop tool
6. **Save the processed image** in your preferred format

### Advanced Features

#### Batch Processing
![Batch Processing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feature-Batch%20Processing-blue)
=======


1. Select the "Batch Processing" option from the Tools menu
2. Add images to the queue by clicking "Add Images"
3. Configure processing settings on the right panel
4. Click "Start Processing" to apply settings to all images
5. Set output folder and format preferences

#### Filter Gallery
![Filter Gallery](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feature-Filter%20Gallery-blue)
=======


1. Open the Filter Gallery from the Filters menu
2. Browse filter categories on the left panel
3. Click on a filter thumbnail to preview the effect
4. Adjust filter parameters using the sliders
5. Click "Apply" to add the filter to your image

### Tips
* For best results with background removal, use images with clear subject-background separation
* PNG format preserves transparency, while JPG provides smaller file sizes
* Use the Reset Image button to revert to the original image at any time
* Create filter presets to quickly apply your favorite adjustments to new images
* Use keyboard shortcuts (listed in the Help menu) for faster workflow

## Performance Considerations
* Processing high-resolution images may require additional system resources
* Recommended system specifications:
  * 8GB RAM or higher
  * Multi-core processor
  * 100MB free disk space for installation
  * Additional space for processed images
